# React-Flashcards-App
Welcome to my React Flashcards repository! This React application is a reflection of my journey in learning React, aimed at helping others study and reinforce their knowledge of React concepts in a fun and interactive way. 

## Getting Started
1. clone the repo
2. open the terminal and run "npm i" to install the packages
3. type "cd my-app" to select the my-app folder
4. type "nmp start" to start React and open the UI
5. Have fun! 

## Overview
This is a simple React-based Flashcards App designed to help users study and memorize information using digital flashcards. Users can create decks of flashcards, add cards to these decks, and quiz themselves on the content.

##Interactive Flashcards:

- Click on a card to reveal its answer: easily toggle between question and answer views for efficient studying.
- Deletion Functionality: Remove flashcards that you have mastered or no longer need.

## Tech Stack
- React
- React router

##Contributing
If you have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome and appreciated! 
This is just a small project that I am aiming to add extrea features:
- editing the flashcards.
- create different pages with different topics.
- store data in a db.

## Folder Structure
src/components: React components for different parts of the application.
src/data: Sample data or API calls for fetching flashcards.
src/styles: Stylesheets for styling the components.
